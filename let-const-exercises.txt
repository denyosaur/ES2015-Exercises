Quiz
What is the difference between var and let?
Var has global scope and the value will be hoisted upwards. It can also be redeclared by reusing the var keyword.
Let is block scoped and will remain only in the block it was defined in. It cannot be redeclared by using let keyword.

What is the difference between var and const?
Const has block scope, where var has global scope. Var variables are also hoisted upwards whereas const is not.

What is the difference between let and const?
The value given in const cannot be changed unless it is a non-primitive value (i.e. object, array). A value must also be given when it is declared.

What is hoisting?
Hoisting is when the JS file "moves" variables declared by var to the top. This allows variables to be used before it is declared.
